- `skills.js` - Handles the skills section with technology data
- `projects.js` - Manages project portfolio information
- `recommendations.js` - Controls testimonials and the recommendation form
- `animations.js` - Implements all UI animations and interactions
- `script.js` - Main entry point that orchestrates all modules

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the portfolio website.
